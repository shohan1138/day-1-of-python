# Day 1 of Python

This repository contains beginner-level Python scripts created on the first day of learning Python. Each file demonstrates basic concepts such as input/output, variable manipulation, and string operations.

## Files Description

### `band_name_generation.py`
A simple script that generates a band name based on user input. It asks for the user's city and pet name, then combines them to create a fun band name.

### `change_variable.py`
Demonstrates how to assign and reassign values to variables. Useful for understanding how variables work in Python.

### `print_input_variable_len.py`
Takes user input and prints the length of the input string. This helps illustrate how to use the `len()` function and handle user input.
